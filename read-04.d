- URLSearchParams allows us to manipulate the query string of a URL.

- URLSearchParams.append() - Appends a specified key/value pair as a new search parameter. 
- URLSearchParams.delete() - Deletes the given search parameter, and its associated value, from the list of all search parameters. 
- URLSearchParams.entries() - Returns an iterator allowing iteration through all key/value pairs contained in this object. 
- URLSearchParams.forEach() - Allows iteration through all values contained in this object via a callback function. 
- URLSearchParams.get() - Returns the first value associated with the given search parameter. 
- URLSearchParams.getAll() - Returns all the values associated with a given search parameter. 
- URLSearchParams.has() - Returns a Boolean indicating if such a given parameter exists. 
- URLSearchParams.keys() - Returns an iterator allowing iteration through all keys of the key/value pairs contained in this object. URLSearchParams.set() - Sets the value associated with a given search parameter to the given value. If there are several values, the others are deleted. 
- URLSearchParams.sort() - Sorts all key/value pairs, if any, by their keys. 
- URLSearchParams.toString() - Returns a string containing a query string suitable for use in a 
URL. 
- URLSearchParams.values() - Returns an iterator allowing iteration through all values of the key/value pairs contained in this object.


- Regex is useful in extracting info from text by searching for matches in a search pattern.
- Works in validation, parsing/replacing strings, passing thru translating data, and web scraping.
- The syntax is the same in almost all programming languages.


- Asynchronous means things can happen independently of the main program flow.
- Javascript is synchronous by default
- JS uses the browser for asynchronicity
- A callback is a function that’s passed to another function.
- Callbacks add layers of nesting and complexity.
- A promise is a proxy for a value that will eventually become available.
- A promise is called in “pending” state
