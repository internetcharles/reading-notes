- an Architectural Pattern is a general and reusable solution to an occurring problem in a particular context.
- an Architectural Pattern is a way to solve a recurring architectural problem, while an Architectural Style is a name given to a recurrent Architectural Design.
- A single architecture can contain several Architectural Styles, and each Architectural Style can make use of several Architectural Patterns.
- An Idiom is a low-level pattern specific to a programming language.
- Container components “[a]re concerned with how things work” In this role they manage state, fetch data from APIs, setup event handlers, and pass information to other components via props.
- Presentation components “[a]re concerned with how things look”. In this role they receive props and use those props to render and style DOM.
- A functional component is just a plain JavaScript function which accepts props as an argument and returns a React element.
