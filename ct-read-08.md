- HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol.
- It's a stateless, application-layer protocol for communicating between distributed systems
-  it assumes very little about a particular system, and does not keep state between different message exchanges.
- Communication between a host and a client occurs, via a request/response pair
- GET: fetch an existing resource. The URL contains all the necessary information the server needs to locate and return the resource.
- POST: create a new resource. POST requests usually carry a payload that specifies the data for the new resource.
- PUT: update an existing resource. The payload may contain the updated data for the resource.
- DELETE: delete an existing resource.
- The domain name system (DNS) brings the two together and gets you to your destination.
