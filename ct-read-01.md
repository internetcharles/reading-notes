- In object-oriented programming, a class is an extensible program-code-template for creating objects, providing initial values for state (member variables) and implementations of behavior (member functions or methods).
- Class is useful for object-oriented programming.
- Classes can be defined inside other expressions.
- The Model-View-Controller (MVC) is an architectural pattern that separates an application into three main logical components: the model, the view, and the controller.
    - The Model component corresponds to all the data-related logic that the user works with.
    - The View component is used for all the UI logic of the application.
    - Controllers act as an interface between Model and View components to process all the business logic and incoming requests, manipulate data using the Model component and interact with the Views to render the final output.
    - Controller = brains
    - Model = data
    - View = GUI
